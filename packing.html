        <p class="caption">Figure 6: Time runs slower closer to the mass. Your watch vs. Earth's watch.</p>

        <p>Due to the intense gravitational field, time passes slower near a black hole compared to empty space. This is known as <span class="concept-tag">Gravitational Time Dilation</span>.</p>
        
        <p>This effect is predicted by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. The closer you are to a massive object, the slower time moves for you relative to an observer far away.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Schedule Alert:</strong> A few hours spent sightseeing near the Event Horizon could mean decades have passed on Earth. This is often called the "Twin Paradox" scenario—if you leave your twin on Earth, you will return younger than them!

        <h3>Packing List:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A Good Book (or 100):</strong> If you are waiting for a rescue that will never come, you'll have plenty of time.</li>
            <li><strong>Tidal Force Resistant Suit:</strong> Essential to delay spaghettification (results may vary).</li>
            <li><strong>No Watch Needed:</strong> Your watch will tick slower than your friends' watches back on Earth. Bringing one just makes the math confusing.</li>
            <li><strong>Redshift Filter:</strong> Light climbing out of the gravity well loses energy and becomes "redder" (<span class="concept-tag">Gravitational Redshift</span>). Bring a filter to correct your photos!</li>
        </ul>
