# The Interstellar Traveler’s Guide to Black Holes

**Project Format:** Educational Website / Creative Guide

## Plan
I plan to create an exploratory website titled **"The Interstellar Traveler’s Guide to Black Holes."** The site will be designed as a digital safety brochure for future space tourists planning to visit a black hole.

The website will feature an interactive menu allowing users to "explore" different sections of a black hole. For example, a "Safety Warnings" page will explain the **Event Horizon** and why nothing can escape it, while a "Sightseeing" page will use diagrams to explain the **Accretion Disc** and **Gravitational Lensing**.

This format allows me to combine accurate physics definitions with a creative, exploratory theme, making complex topics like **Time Dilation** easier to understand for a general audience.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Homepage / Welcome Center
- `safety.html`: Safety Warnings (Event Horizon, Spaghettification)
- `sightseeing.html`: Sightseeing (Accretion Disc, Gravitational Lensing)
- `packing.html`: What to Pack (Time Dilation)
- `style.css`: Stylesheet for the space theme
