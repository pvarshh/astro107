# The Interstellar Traveler’s Guide to Black Holes

Welcome to the ultimate digital safety brochure for future space tourists! This website is a creative educational guide designed to explain the complex physics of black holes through the lens of a travel agency.

## About the Project

This project transforms a standard physics lesson into an interactive "Travel Guide." Instead of dry textbook definitions, users explore the dangers and wonders of black holes as if they were planning a vacation.

The guide covers accurate scientific concepts including:
- **The Event Horizon:** Why it's the ultimate "point of no return."
- **Spaghettification:** The dangers of tidal forces.
- **Time Dilation:** Why you might need a new calendar when you get back.
- **Accretion Discs & Gravitational Lensing:** The spectacular views you'll see (if you survive).

## Site Structure

- **`index.html`**: The Welcome Center and main hub.
- **`safety.html`**: Critical warnings about the Event Horizon and Spaghettification.
- **`sightseeing.html`**: A guide to the visual phenomena like the Accretion Disc.
- **`packing.html`**: Essential tips for dealing with Time Dilation and Redshift.
- **`resources.html`**: A glossary of terms and image credits.
