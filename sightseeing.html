        <h2>The Accretion Disc</h2>
        <img src="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a010000/a013300/a013326/simulated_bh.jpg" alt="Accretion Disc showing Doppler Beaming" class="content-image">
        <p class="caption">Figure 4: A simulation of a black hole's accretion disc. Note how the left side is brighter than the right due to Doppler Beaming (NASA/Goddard/Jeremy Schnittman).</p>

        <p>Surrounding the black hole, you will likely see a swirling disk of gas and dust falling in. This is the <span class="concept-tag">Accretion Disc</span>.</p>
        <p>Friction within the disc heats the material to millions of degrees, causing it to glow brightly in X-rays and other wavelengths. It's a beautiful, deadly ring of fire.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> You will notice that one side of the disc appears brighter and bluer than the other. This is due to <strong>Doppler Beaming</strong>. The material moving <em>towards</em> you is brighter (blueshifted), while the material moving <em>away</em> is dimmer (redshifted).</p>

        <h2>Gravitational Lensing</h2>
        <img src="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a010000/a013300/a013326/BH_optics_explained.jpg" alt="Gravitational Lensing Diagram" class="content-image">
        <p class="caption">Figure 5: How gravity bends light to create the "halo" or Einstein Ring (NASA/Goddard).</p>

        <p>Black holes bend light so intensely that they act like a giant lens. This phenomenon is called <span class="concept-tag">Gravitational Lensing</span>.</p>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Photo Op:</strong> Look closely at the edge of the black hole's shadow. You might see a distorted image of the stars behind the black hole, or even the back of the accretion disc bent over the top!
        </div>

        <p>Because gravity bends light, you can theoretically see the back of your own head if you orbit at the <strong>Photon Sphere</strong> ($1.5 \times R_s$). Light orbits the black hole in a circle here, meaning if you look straight ahead, you see your own back!</p>
        
        <h3>The Shadow</h3>
        <p>The dark area in the center is not just the event horizon itself, but the <strong>Shadow</strong> of the black hole. Because gravity bends light inward, the shadow appears about 2.6 times larger than the actual event horizon.</p>
