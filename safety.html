        <h2>CRITICAL WARNING: The Event Horizon</h2>
        <img src="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a010000/a013300/a013326/BH_labeled.jpg" alt="Diagram of Event Horizon and Photon Ring" class="content-image">
        <p class="caption">Figure 2: A NASA simulation showing the Event Horizon (black center) and the Photon Ring.</p>

        <p>The <span class="concept-tag">Event Horizon</span> is the point of no return. It is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape. The radius of this boundary is known as the <strong>Schwarzschild Radius</strong> ($R_s$), which depends entirely on the mass of the black hole.</p>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>DANGER:</strong> Do not cross this line. Once you pass the Event Horizon, the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light ($c$). Since nothing can travel faster than light, you will be unable to send a distress signal or return home.

        <h3>Hazard: Spaghettification</h3>
        <img src="https://cdn.eso.org/images/screen/eso2018a.jpg" alt="Artist impression of a star being spaghettified by a black hole" class="content-image">
        <p class="caption">Figure 3: An artist's impression of a star being ripped apart by tidal forces (ESO/M. Kornmesser).</p>

        <p>As you get closer to the singularity (the center), the difference in gravitational pull between your feet and your head becomes extreme. This is due to <strong>Tidal Forces</strong>, which grow stronger as you get closer to the source of gravity (following an inverse-cube law).</p>
        
        <p>This force will stretch you vertically and compress you horizontally. In the industry, we call this <span class="concept-tag">Spaghettification</span>. It is exactly as painful as it sounds.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Safety Recommendation:</strong> Stick to <strong>Supermassive Black Holes</strong> if you want to cross the horizon alive. The tidal forces are weaker at the horizon of a supermassive black hole compared to a smaller stellar-mass black hole. (Though you still can't come back!)</p>

        <h3>Long-Term Risk: Hawking Radiation</h3>
        <p>Think you can wait it out inside? Think again. Due to quantum effects near the horizon, black holes slowly lose mass over time, emitting particles known as <strong>Hawking Radiation</strong>. Eventually, the black hole will evaporate completely—taking you with it.</p>
